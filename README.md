# Discord Updater for Linux
This is a **bash** script for updating Discord. Ye that's it. Nothing fancy I guess.

## Requirements:
- **wget** for downloading the new discord version
- **tar** for unpacking the downloaded .tar.gz
- **jq** for versionchecking of the installed and downloaded version

## When to use the updater
You can use this script in two scenarios.\
(1) You don't have discord installed yet and want to install it.\
(2) Discord gave you a pop up that there is a new version and you don't want to use the .deb file or flathub or whatever ...

## How to use

Step 1: Download the repo\
Step 2: Execute the bash file without sudo\
<code>
./discord-updater.sh
</code>\
Step 3: Enter password

## What I will maybe add in the future
- Skip the Discord update notification\

- script only 69 long
- whatever I find interesting and is related to this project
